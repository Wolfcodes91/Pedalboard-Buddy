### Info
Pedalboard Buddy is an app for musicians who use effect pedals. In this app, you can add/edit/delete and view your own list of pedals, as well as being able to view and use the pedals that other users have entered in to the database.
Create your own pedalboards by clicking and dragging pedals from the list to the board. You can move the positions of pedals and save your changes. Save as many boards as you wish! Happy pedalboard building from your Pedalboard Buddy!

### Directions

Add a pedal to the list by entering the brand, name, size, and a picture in to the pedal adding form. If you make a mistake entering your pedal info, or don't like the picture you chose, you may edit your pedal and change any of the info, as well as add a new pic.  
Drag your pedals to the pedalboard, move them around to your liking then Name your board and click save!
You may recall your past saved boards and edit them and resave them. If you don't like your saved board anymore you may delete it. At any time the "clear" button will move all the pedals on the board back to the Pedals List. Thats all there is to it!
